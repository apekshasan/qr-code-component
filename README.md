## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

How to properly integrate BootStrap with HTML , use it to make cards and center them using flexbox in CSS.

Used margin property in Bootstrap and used two selectors at once in CSS

```html
<div class="card m-auto vertical-center">
```
```css
.footer, .footer a {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```
